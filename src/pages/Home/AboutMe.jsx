                  Hello! I'm a seasoned freelance hair and makeup artist based in Taguig, specializing in Traditional and High-Definition Makeup. With a rich background in fashion and creative studio photoshoots, I was recently honored as the "Most Outstanding Individual Achiever in Makeup Artistry" at the Asian Sterling Awards. Grateful for my family's unwavering support and inspired by Ms. Leina Montealto of "GLAM PILIPINAS," I've grown both personally and professionally.
